Problem – Heaps of food waste that gathers on large fields and water bodies will eventually decay and start to produce greenhouse gasses such as CO2 and
even worse, Methane. In a large waste deposit area where unrecycled food waste is left to rot, theses gasses will start to accumulate and eventually rise up to the ozone layer. When 
this happens the ozone layer will start to decay and deadly UV rays will start to leak into the atmosphere. Directly causing the earth’s heat level to go up.
Solution- Our solution to this is to get in between the general public and more importantly large restaurants and hotels. We are aiming to make the jobs of 
the municipal people easier by recruiting people to collect food waste from all the abovementioned places. Our web app will have a store as well as a 
donate section, where willing people can donate to keep the services going. Collectors can be informed by people who have accumulated garbage, so that 
they can come pick it up and dispose of it or recycle it responsibly
